# slither.io-v0
`slither.io-v0` is an openAI gym enviroment for testing and evaluating reinforcment learning algorithms in a challenging enviroment such as slither.io. The enviroment has a reasonably large field with multiple snakes;snakes grow  when eating randomly-appearing fruit; a snake dies when colliding with another snake, itself, or the wall; and the game ends when all snakes die. Start with two snakes, and scale from there
